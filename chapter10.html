                <h2>1. Emissions trends and drivers</h2>
                <p>Our provisional estimates suggest that the shipping sector contributed around 3%
                    of total UK emissions in 2021. Just over half of this came from international shipping,
                    with the remainder from the domestic sector.</p>
                <p>Emissions had fallen by around 2% per year over the past decade, before a
                    16% reduction in 2020 (Figure 10.1). Our estimates suggest that they
                    rebounded by 4% in 2021 but remained 13% below 2019 levels.</p>
                <p>The 2020 fall was due to reductions in global shipping demand, with
                    overall freight tonnages moved through UK ports 9% lower than in
                    2019. These were caused by responses to the pandemic, and
                    provisional statistics1 show that this disruption continued into 2021 with
                    total freight rebounding only 2%.</p>
                <p>The emissions savings over the preceding decade were driven in part
                    by a 26% fall in domestic shipping activity and a 7% reduction in
                    outbound international freight shipping, due largely to significant
                    reductions in the quantities of oil and coal being transported. In
                    addition, global vessel carbon intensities improved by around 30%
                    between 2008 and 2018.</p>

                <h2>2. Indicators of progress</h2>
                <p>The range of actions and conditions that combine to enable decarbonisation of
                    shipping has been summarised. The details of how these work together to
                    deliver the sectorâ€™s decarbonisation pathway are introduced in our
                    accompanying Monitoring Framework.</p>
                <p>We hope to update our indicators to allow more granular monitoring of the
                    enablers that will deliver the key decarbonisation outcomes for the sector, such as
                    the uptake of low-carbon fuels and the availability of shore-side electrification
                    infrastructure, based on the approach set out in the Course to Zero strategy
                    expected later in the year. For now, we monitor a subset of indicators. Progress this
                    year on these indicators is shown in Table 10.1.</p>
                <p>At present, take-up of both low-carbon fuels and electrification are essentially zero.
                    They are not yet reported in regular publications, and should be in future.</p>

                <p>Most of the abatement required in the Net Zero delivery pathway for shipping is
                    driven by uptake of low-carbon fuels from the 2030s onwards. While UK policy is
                    showing positive steps in supporting early innovation in this market, the slow nature
                    of current international progress represents a significant delivery risk (Figure 10.3).</p>
                <p>Through the policy measures outlined in the previous section, we assess that the
                    Government and the devolved administrations have achieved one, partly
                    achieved one, and not achieved one of the recommendations for the shipping
                    sector in our 2021 Progress Report. A further four recommendations were of a more
                    ongoing nature, and of these one is showing clear signs of positive progress, two
                    have seen some but insufficient progress, and one has shown no progress.</p>
