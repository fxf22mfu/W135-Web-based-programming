                <h2>1. Emissions trends and drivers</h2>
                <p>Emissions in 2020 were 10% below 2019 levels. This was driven partly by the
                    marked decrease in fossil fuel consumption (Figure 7.2) due to travel
                    restrictions during the lockdown, which led to a reduction in refining output
                    and oil and gas production. Indeed, in each of these sectors, emissions in
                    2020 fell by 1.5 MtCO2 and 1.7 MtCO2, respectively, compared to 2019
                    levels.</p>
                <p>Indeed, coal demand in the UK has continued to fall, especially in the
                    electricity sector, which contributed to 59% of emissions reductions in
                    the fuel supply sector since 1990. Over half of the remaining emissions
                    from the coal mining sub-sector are due to methane leakage from
                    closed coal mines, rather than ongoing coal mining. As mines
                    continue to close in the UK, there is less and less scope for emissions
                    reductions in this area.</p>
                <p>Declining oil and gas reserves have led to reduced production, and
                    therefore emissions reductions. Remaining recoverable oil reserves
                    have decreased by 44% since 1995, and gas reserves by 75% in the
                    same period.6 This trend is set to continue as oil and gas production is
                    expected to decline by 6% on average per year to 2030.</p>
                <p>Emissions from methane leakage in the gas transmission and
                    distribution networks reduced notably thanks to the Iron Mains Risk
                    Reduction Programme (IMRRP),8 with gas network emissions reduced
                    by 46% since 2002 when the programme was introduced. Emissions in
                    this area should continue to decline as the IMRRP is set to run until
                    2032.</p>

                <h2>2. Indicators of progress</h2>
                <p>This section sets out the key indicators of progress for the fossil fuel supply sector. For
                    hydrogen and bioenergy supply, the Committee intends to develop a set of
                    indicators for next year’s Progress Report considering, respectively, the recent
                    Energy Security Strategy ambitions and the publication of Government’s Biomass
                    Strategy later in 2022.</p>
                <p>A detailed approach on the indicators developed to represent progress in fuel
                    supply sector is shown in our accompanying Monitoring Framework.</p>
                <p>In tracking progress on reducing emissions from oil and gas production, we
                    use indicators for both total emissions and the emissions-intensity
                    of production (Figure 7.5) as there is considerable uncertainty over future
                    North Sea oil and gas production levels. Both total emissions and emissionsintensity have been broadly flat for the last decade, but significant
                    reductions should be achieved over coming years as production levels
                    decline and as progress is made on methane venting, flaring and
                    electrification of platforms.</p>
                <p>The refineries emissions indicator allows us to track progress against savings
                    due to implementation of CCS and greater energy efficiency, as well as
                    how fossil fuel demand decreases as a consequence of switching away
                    from petroleum. Fall in emissions from refineries are currently associated with
                    the downward trend in refinery output (partly due to switching away from
                    fossil fuel use) rather than decarbonisation of refineries (Figure 7.6).</p>

                <h2>3. Policy progress, assessment and next steps</h2>
                <p>The Government recently published an update to the North Sea Transition Deal9
                    that reaffirms Government and industry commitments to reduce emissions in the
                    sector by 50% below 2018 levels by 2030, aligned with the Net Zero Strategy. The
                    North Sea Transition Authority* (NSTA) has embedded the 50% target in its Strategy
                    and Stewardship Expectation to guide and monitor the industry.</p>
                <p>This target is less ambitious than the 68% reduction we estimated could be
                    achieved in the sector. Given the potential increase in North Sea oil and gas
                    production presented in the ESS and incentivised as part of the recent Energy
                    Profits Levy,10 the Government’s commitment to reduce emissions by 50% is
                    insufficient. Industry should be redoubling efforts to cut emissions at source,
                    required and incentivised by Government policy and NSTA regulation.</p>
                <p>The Government announced in the ESS a licensing round for oil and gas
                    exploration in the Autumn, which will be subject to the new Climate
                    Compatibility Checkpoint. We wrote to the Government in response to the
                    recent consultation on the Checkpoint,3 which advised the Government to
                    set stringent climate tests for licensing of exploration as well as to later
                    development stages (e.g. consenting of production).</p>
                <p>Some initial actions are ongoing to support the electrification of offshore
                    platforms. Crown Estate Scotland has developed the project Innovation
                    and Targeted Oil and Gas (INTOG) leasing round, specifically, for
                    integration of offshore wind projects into oil and gas installations.</p>
                <p>The NSTA has published the updated flaring and venting guidance, which
                    sets out measures for all facilities to achieve zero routine flaring and venting
                    by 2030. In parallel, the industry will deliver individual action plans by 2022,
                    reinforcing requirements to prevent gas waste emissions for reasons other
                    than safety.</p>
                <p>Actions on reducing methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas
                    sector, including onshore terminals, are required as part of the UK’s
                    contributions under the Global Methane Pledge, an international initiative
                    to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030, relative to 2020. The
                    oil and gas sector set out its methane emissions pledge and the target to
                    reduce halve its methane emissions by 2030.</p>
