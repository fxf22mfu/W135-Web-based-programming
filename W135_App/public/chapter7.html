            <h3>1. Emissions trends and drivers</h3>
            <p>Emissions in 2020 were 10% below 2019 levels. This was driven partly by the
                marked decrease in fossil fuel consumption (Figure 7.2) due to travel
                restrictions during the lockdown, which led to a reduction in refining output
                and oil and gas production. Indeed, in each of these sectors, emissions in
                2020 fell by 1.5 MtCO2 and 1.7 MtCO2, respectively, compared to 2019
                levels.</p>
            <p>Indeed, coal demand in the UK has continued to fall, especially in the
                electricity sector, which contributed to 59% of emissions reductions in
                the fuel supply sector since 1990. Over half of the remaining emissions
                from the coal mining sub-sector are due to methane leakage from
                closed coal mines, rather than ongoing coal mining. As mines
                continue to close in the UK, there is less and less scope for emissions
                reductions in this area.</p>
            <p>Declining oil and gas reserves have led to reduced production, and
                therefore emissions reductions. Remaining recoverable oil reserves
                have decreased by 44% since 1995, and gas reserves by 75% in the
                same period.6 This trend is set to continue as oil and gas production is
                expected to decline by 6% on average per year to 2030.</p>
            <p>Emissions from methane leakage in the gas transmission and
                distribution networks reduced notably thanks to the Iron Mains Risk
                Reduction Programme (IMRRP),8 with gas network emissions reduced
                by 46% since 2002 when the programme was introduced. Emissions in
                this area should continue to decline as the IMRRP is set to run until
                2032.</p>

            <h3>2. Indicators of progress</h3>
            <p>This section sets out the key indicators of progress for the fossil fuel supply sector. For
                hydrogen and bioenergy supply, the Committee intends to develop a set of
                indicators for next year’s Progress Report considering, respectively, the recent
                Energy Security Strategy ambitions and the publication of Government’s Biomass
                Strategy later in 2022.</p>
            <p>A detailed approach on the indicators developed to represent progress in fuel
                supply sector is shown in our accompanying Monitoring Framework.</p>
            <p>In tracking progress on reducing emissions from oil and gas production, we
                use indicators for both total emissions and the emissions-intensity
                of production (Figure 7.5) as there is considerable uncertainty over future
                North Sea oil and gas production levels. Both total emissions and emissionsintensity have been broadly flat for the last decade, but significant
                reductions should be achieved over coming years as production levels
                decline and as progress is made on methane venting, flaring and
                electrification of platforms.</p>
            <p>The refineries emissions indicator allows us to track progress against savings
                due to implementation of CCS and greater energy efficiency, as well as
                how fossil fuel demand decreases as a consequence of switching away
                from petroleum. Fall in emissions from refineries are currently associated with
                the downward trend in refinery output (partly due to switching away from
                fossil fuel use) rather than decarbonisation of refineries (Figure 7.6).</p>

            <h3>3. Policy progress, assessment and next steps</h3>
            <p>The Government recently published an update to the North Sea Transition Deal9
                that reaffirms Government and industry commitments to reduce emissions in the
                sector by 50% below 2018 levels by 2030, aligned with the Net Zero Strategy. The
                North Sea Transition Authority* (NSTA) has embedded the 50% target in its Strategy
                and Stewardship Expectation to guide and monitor the industry.</p>
            <p>This target is less ambitious than the 68% reduction we estimated could be
                achieved in the sector. Given the potential increase in North Sea oil and gas
                production presented in the ESS and incentivised as part of the recent Energy
                Profits Levy,10 the Government’s commitment to reduce emissions by 50% is
                insufficient. Industry should be redoubling efforts to cut emissions at source,
                required and incentivised by Government policy and NSTA regulation.</p>
            <p>The Government announced in the ESS a licensing round for oil and gas
                exploration in the Autumn, which will be subject to the new Climate
                Compatibility Checkpoint. We wrote to the Government in response to the
                recent consultation on the Checkpoint,3 which advised the Government to
                set stringent climate tests for licensing of exploration as well as to later
                development stages (e.g. consenting of production).</p>
            <p>Some initial actions are ongoing to support the electrification of offshore
                platforms. Crown Estate Scotland has developed the project Innovation
                and Targeted Oil and Gas (INTOG) leasing round, specifically, for
                integration of offshore wind projects into oil and gas installations.</p>
            <p>The NSTA has published the updated flaring and venting guidance, which
                sets out measures for all facilities to achieve zero routine flaring and venting
                by 2030. In parallel, the industry will deliver individual action plans by 2022,
                reinforcing requirements to prevent gas waste emissions for reasons other
                than safety.</p>
            <p>Actions on reducing methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas
                sector, including onshore terminals, are required as part of the UK’s
                contributions under the Global Methane Pledge, an international initiative
                to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030, relative to 2020. The
                oil and gas sector set out its methane emissions pledge and the target to
                reduce halve its methane emissions by 2030.</p>
