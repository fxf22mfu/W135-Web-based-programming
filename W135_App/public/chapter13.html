            <h3>1. Indicators of progress</h3>
            <p>This section sets out key indicators of progress within the engineered removals
                sector (Table 13.1).</p>
            <p>Indicators for the UK are the total deployment of engineered removals, and
                of the contributions to this total from BECCS, DACCS and Wood in
                Construction (WiC). BECCS, DACCS, or a combination of the two, are
                expected in the Net Zero Strategy to start removing CO2 in the late 2020s.
                Underpinning developments in CCS infrastructure need to be scaled up this
                year and are being tracked through the indicator on industrial CCS
                candidate projects in Chapter 5 and the indicator on CO2 storage licences
                in Chapter 14.</p>
            <p>In addition to UK-located deployment, international progress on DACCS
                capacity is an important indicator to track as scale-up experience and
                shared lessons from international projects could allow the UK’s take up of
                DACCS to happen more rapidly and cost effectively.</p>
            <p>Following the setting out of market support mechanisms for engineered
                removals (see Policy Progress below), we may in future introduce indicators
                tracking progress on candidate UK engineered removals projects</p>

            <h3>2. Policy progress, assessment and next steps</h3>
            <p>To date, the UK Government has undertaken evidence-gathering on the role of
                engineered removals in reaching Net Zero and provided ongoing support for R&D.
                Targeted dates for scale up of engineered removals are now fast approaching.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experience with similar facilities suggests it is likely to take around four to six
                    years for the UK’s first large-scale engineered removals facilities to become
                    operational covering design engineering, full planning and consenting,
                    contract negotiations, final investment decision, and build and
                    commissioning.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Government must therefore use 2022 and the start of 2023 to make
                        rapid progress towards setting in place a comprehensive delivery
                        package comprising financial, technical and institutional (MRV)
                        policies and setting out clear timelines for decisions.</li>
                    <li>Hard-to-abate sectors may rely on the reductions in emissions from
                        engineered removals for offsetting their residual emissions in the 2030s
                        and 2040s. These interactions between sectors should be considered
                        when allocating the burden of financial support for engineered
                        removals between different actors in upcoming business model
                        decisions.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Net Zero Strategy allows for 11-34 MtCO2 of engineered removals
                    annually by 2035. This speed of scale-up in the early 2030s means that
                    Government policies around funding, MRV and biomass use must be ready
                    to support 5 MtCO2 of removals as a minimum, not a maximum, in 2030.
                    </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This step change in scale-up in the 2030s must also be considered in
                        ensuring that energy system and CCS networks around potential
                        BECCS or DACCS sites have sufficient capacity.</li>
                    <li>Consideration should also be given to measures that might be taken
                        to further reduce emissions in other sectors should such rapid scale-up
                        in engineered removals prove too technically challenging, expensive,
                        or sustainability criteria are not met.</li>
                    <li>Growing activity on DACCS internationally suggests potential for
                        DACCS to contribute to UK engineered removals deployment this
                        decade (Box 14.2). Subject to sufficient support, this might result in
                        different relative scales and timings of contributions from BECCS and
                        DACCS than suggested in the CCC Balanced Pathway where largescale (1Mt CO2+) DACCS deployment occurs in the 2040s.
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Alongside market establishment, Government must be proactive in ensuring
                    that all removals are sustainable and that the MRV systems that measure
                    net CO2 removed and the permanency of storage are set out in a
                    transparent and robust way that are understood and accepted by the
                    public.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comprehensive MRV frameworks for feedstock sustainability and
                        encouraging diet change to free up land for domestic feedstock
                        production are both important steps towards establishing BECCS as a
                        viable long-term decarbonisation option for the UK.
                        </li>
                    <li>Addressing sustainability concerns and improving public understanding
                        around the underpinning science and emissions reduction potential of
                        different engineered removals technologies is a key step in securing
                        public acceptance ahead of large-scale deployment.
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Engineered removals are expected to contribute to medium-term emissions
                    reduction targets and Net Zero targets both for UK-wide, and in the UK
                    constituent nations. However, initial UK deployment of engineered removals
                    is likely to be operating in just a handful of sites (e.g. as part of CCS clusters),
                    which might be located in just one part of the UK, particularly in the 2030s. In
                    the next year, HMG and the devolved administrations should work together
                    to publish a joint position on the allocation of engineered and other
                    removals towards contributing to UK-wide and devolved administration
                    targets.</li>
